# BT-Timsheet-Fixer

Python script to take poorly formatted csv sheets from BT and turn them into something useable. This is largely done so that the bookkeeper does not destroy the SQL database which stores the majority of company data.

While the script is specific to working with BT Systems it can be easily repurposed for other quick timesheet manipulations.
